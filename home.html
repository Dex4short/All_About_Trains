          The era of steam engines spanned from the 18th century to the 20th century. 
          While the exact dates can vary depending on specific regions and applications, this general time frame captures the rise and fall of steam power. 
          While steam engines are no longer the primary source of power in most industries, they continue to be used in some niche applications and are preserved for historical and recreational purposes.

          The story of steam engines is intertwined with the Industrial Revolution, a period of rapid technological and economic growth that transformed society. 
          The first practical steam engine was invented by Thomas Newcomen in 1712. 
          His atmospheric engine was a bulky device used primarily to pump water out of coal mines. 
          It worked by creating a vacuum using steam, which pulled a piston up, and then atmospheric pressure pushed the piston back down. 
          While inefficient, Newcomen's engine was a crucial step in the development of steam power. 
          James Watt, a Scottish engineer, made significant improvements to Newcomen's design. 
          In 1769, Watt patented his separate condenser, which allowed the steam to condense away from the cylinder, making the engine much more efficient. 
          This innovation was a major breakthrough and helped to popularize the use of steam engines in various industries.

          Watt's improved steam engine played a pivotal role in the Industrial Revolution. 
          It powered machinery in factories, drove locomotives on railways, and propelled ships across the seas. 
          The widespread adoption of steam engines led to increased productivity, urbanization, and economic growth. 
          As the 19th century progressed, new technologies, such as internal combustion engines and electric motors, began to emerge. 
          These technologies offered greater efficiency, portability, and flexibility than steam engines. As a result, the dominance of steam power gradually declined.

          Despite their eventual replacement by newer technologies, steam engines left a lasting legacy. 
          They played a crucial role in shaping the modern world, and their impact can still be seen in various industries and cultural artifacts.

          Purpose:

          The purpose of this website is to provide information about steam engines where enthusiasts can access and learn the history, the engineers, and their inventions of locomotives. 
          There are no certain number of locomotives that were built throughout the history because of constant changing due to the factors such us production rates. 
          This educational web site will also provide information that the users need to consult historical records from locomotive manufacturers, railway companies, and government agencies.
